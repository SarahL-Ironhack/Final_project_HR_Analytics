Pleased to e-meet you! It is hard to know someone by their picture or a few lines on their professional experience. Here are a few information on what are my strengths and values :

STRENGHFINDER TEST (2019)

1. Positivity - Generous with praise, quick to smile and always on the lookout for the bright side of a situation. 
2. Developer – I’ll always look for the potential in others and I think all individuals are “a work in progress”. Coaching is one of my favorite aspects of my work
3. Responsibility –I’ll always take ownership for anything I commit to. I feel emotionally bound to follow it through to completion and if I cannot deliver, I’ll try and make up for it somehow.
4. Analytical – My analytical skills are not just about “data and numbers” as for me, taking time to analyze situations and people is also very important. 
5. Harmony – In case of conflict or differing views, I always look for areas of agreement. For me getting “win-win” solutions is a professional and personal goal.

DISC TEST (2020) - Behavioral Style : Assessor

Assessors apply creative focus to practical, workable concepts and make them doable. They engage others with persuasion rather than through aggressive methods. They are good at explaining their ideas and the steps required to reach their goals. 

Your Strengths:
•	You are people-oriented, so you have the ability to get along with a wide variety of people.
•	You bring a positive sense of humor and know how to break the ice or combat hostility tactfully.
•	You show a high level of respect for established systems and organizational protocol.
•	In meetings, you will communicate your opinions in a positive and solution-oriented way.
•	You are deadline-savvy and able to juggle many issues simultaneously.
•	You bring a strong sense of quality control to the team's efforts.
•	You bring a sense of genuine enthusiasm to the team and organization.

MY TOP VALUES

-	Genuiness : I’m honest, transparent and will always remain myself
-	Positivity : The glass is always half-full!
-	Caring : I’ll always have people’s best interest in mind 
-	Trust : I’ll make sure people can trust me and for me, to be able to trust others is essential
-	Fun : Whoever says HR are dull people, I’ll prove them wrong 😉

Le Review Management, qui permet aux enseignes ou aux directeurs de magasins de centraliser les avis locaux reçus sur leur(s) établissement(s), d’y répondre et de les analyser depuis une interface unique.

Et le Review Booster, qui permet aux points de vente d’inciter leurs clients à laisser des avis positifs sur leur fiche Google My Business via des invitations par SMS.

Over the past few years, I contributed to the launch and development of several projects with a positive impact on various industries:

- Local food -
I launched DuBonPain.fr in 2013 to help artisanal bakers promote themselves online. The company became Monbanquet in 2016 and pivoted to a B2B catering platform empowering local food artisans.  From 2016 to 2020, Monbanquet helped +100 food shop owners generate +7M€ additional revenues, and organised more than 10,000 events across France. To achieve that, we were a team a 30+ people and we raised 3M€ with top VC-firms.
The company was first sold to an international competitor in Jan. 2020, then sold again to another French player due to a restructuration after COVID. I left it in December 2020 after making sure the company would restart after the pandemic is over.

- Social exclusion and homelessness - 
I helped launch the non-profit organization Entourage in 2015 as a Product Director and later became administrator. Entourage aims at fighting against exclusion and homelessness by empowering local citizens act and gather. More recently, Entourage launched the Linkedout platform dedicated to find job opportunities to people suffering from social exclusion.

- Equal opportunities -
As a former beneficiary, I now give back to organisations like Article 1 by being a mentor for unprivileged young students. 

- Healthcare - 
I joined Hublo in June 2021 as a Head of New Business, in order to improve human ressources management in healthcare.
Today, Hublo works with more than 2,500 facilities in France and Germany and more than 400,000 nurses. .","Hublo is revolutionizing the management of human resources in health care.

Health care professionals today lack easy to use and efficient HR tools. Recruitment, replacements, planning, remuneration ... personnel management in healthcare establishments is time-consuming and stressful.

The Hublo solution makes it possible to easily and efficiently manage staff replacements, by calling on the volunteers of professionals.

Throughout my years in the IT industry, I have worked with both big name companies including Ernst & Young and Criteo as well as independently with my own privately established IT consulting firm, NMN Advisory Services.  

Often referred to as a “firefighter” I have a reputation for resolving some of the toughest technology and security problems with personal drive and a 360 degree understanding of the Information Security industry. Further, I am known for not only resolving problems, but actively communicating with executive leadership teams to clearly explain highly technical topics and in turn, influence IT strategy. 

With a holistic view on the Information Technology and Information Security industry, I am able to take on virtually all types of projects, but specialize in the following:

✔ RISK MANAGEMENT & INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMPLIANCE PROJECTS with expertise in business process and risk assessment, internal controls optimization, and risk remediation.

☎ I am incredibly passionate about my work and welcome the opportunity to network with other likeminded professionals. To connect with me directly, please send a connection request or reach out on LinkedIn messaging. ","In 2009, I fulfilled a personal dream of opening my own Information Technology Consulting and Security Services firm. After 11 years in IT Security Management with one of the Big Four firms, Ernst & Young, along with multiple certifications and degrees – I was ready to launch my own business which would be known for providing unmatched service quality. 

While open to worldwide clients, I am primarily concentrated on French and African based small-to medium-sized businesses (SME/SBE). For my clients, I provide personalized services in the following specialties: 

✤ IT SECURITY AUDITS, RISK MANAGEMENT & INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMPLIANCE – Via thorough analysis and targeted action plans, areas for IT risk are efficiently pinpointed and eliminated.  

✤ INFORMATION SYSTEMS STRATEGY – I work with clients to devise strategy to structure, streamline, and coordinate information systems, security, and infrastructure components. 

✤ IT OUTSOURCING – I both serve as an outside resource to clients as well as assist in review of potential vendors and ultimate selection of the optimal outsourcing engagement. 

✤ BUSINESS CONTINUITY – In direct coordination with the CTO, CIO and other senior leaders, I develop detailed business continuity plans that equip organizations with directives to ensure a quick organizational response in the face of disaster. 

I pride myself on delivering only the highest quality services to my diverse client base and am often commended for providing fulfilling, practical, and empowering services.

✦ FULFILLING – My clients are confident that all their needs and concerns have been met. 

✦ PRACTICAL – I strive to find pragmatic solutions and quick wins that are cost effective, long-lasting, and straightforward. 

✦ EMPOWERING – Clients are empowered with not only solutions, but also education on how best to implement and ensure the continued success of suggested solutions. 

☎ To get in touch regarding services, please reach out at nndoye@chicagobooth.edu ",France & Africa,"OVERVIEW: In this role, I had 2 distinct functions as both an IT Security Manager and an Information Technology Controls PMO for SOX Compliance. Although I had separate roles, both were united with a common goal of maintaining optimal levels of security and compliancy across IT General Controls and IT Application Controls. 

➥ IT SECURITY MANAGER ROLE: In this position, my focus was on defining and maintaining security policies, standards, and guidelines while also serving as an expert advisor and subject matter expert (SME) to various teams. Additionally, I served as a gatekeeper completing security assessment and questionnaires for clients prior to deals being finalized. 

➥ IT GENERALS CONTROLS PMO FOR SOX COMPLIANCE ROLE: I led the upfront implementation of IT General Controls and IT Application Controls as well as ongoing reporting to the Executive Board on said Controls. 

My key accomplishments with Criteo included the following: 

● Coordinated among 30 worldwide offices, more than 40 teams, 2 direct reports and over 30 indirect reports to gain consensus and establish ownership for the SOX compliance program. 

● Devised a solution to obtain documentation and perform testing on a critical application as part of the SOX compliance program, which involved gaining consensus and buy-in from 30+ developers / DBA / System Admins. As a result, understanding of the entire revenue process and application was secured for the first time ever, which was used for both compliance purposes and ultimately to upgrade the system safely 1 year later.  

● Leveraged the SOX compliance program to fulfill otherwise unmet certification requirements (Criteo was not ISO2700x or ISAE3402 certified, but we were able to bypass these requirements with our SOX program). 95% of our deals were signed despite not having these certifications due to my suggested workaround.

J'ai l'habitude de collaborer avec des équipes de R&D pour leur fournir des solutions logicielles (bibliothèques, services, outils de développement...) faciles à utiliser, performantes et à l'infrastructure robuste.
En dehors de cette expérience, les éléments suivants façonnent ma pratique :
- une esthétique de l'ingénierie logicielle (respect des idiomes, compréhensibilité et facilité d'usage des API, élégance des solutions, etc.) ;
- un pessimisme de rigueur quant au comportement futur des systèmes (lié à mon expérience de SRE) ;
- une rigueur d'analyse (du comportement d'un système existant, de la conception d'un nouveau système) ;
- un plaisir à partager mes connaissances, à former des personnes dans les domaines que je maîtrise ;
- un goût pour les technologies bien conçues (avoir du Node.js en production reste le plus souvent une aberration // je serais enchanté de travaille en Haskell ou Lisp).

Je vis actuellement à Paris et compte y rester.
Je ne suis pas fermé au travail à distance.
Je préfère réserver mon réseau professionnel à des personnes que j'ai rencontrées.

The Business Escalation team was the link between the business and the technical team at Criteo. This implied, when an issue occured: understanding the technical part of the issue and the impact on the business, creating continuous communication channels with business teams, and making sure technical decisions are made according to business priorities.
The team was active 24/7, based in Paris, Tokyo & New-York. I was the lead of the European & Asian teams. As a team lead, I defined yearly & quarterly objectives with my teammates, balancing priorities among a variety of business issues, working closely with stakeholders across the world, in order to respond rapidly to incidents and minimize the impact on Criteo business.

I also participated in Criteo's 24/7 Operations support for emergencies.

Je travaille principalement sur le recrutement des équipes commerciales sur les 2 continents.

Pourquoi 360Learning?
Tout d'abord, pour sa technologie qui rend la formation en entreprise beaucoup plus simple, dynamique et participative. On vous le dit tous les jours: la formation n'a jamais été aussi importante pour faire grandir, fidéliser et accompagner l'évolution de carrière. Pourtant les produits existants sur le marché sont souvent trop chers ou complexes pour les utilisateurs. 360Learning est né de ce constat et propose une réelle solution technique.
Il y a aussi la ""Culture 360Learning"" (voir la vidéo ci-dessous), qui semble vraiment unique: autonomie dans la gestion des objectifs, partage des connaissances, transparence poussée à l'extrême sur les projets de chaque membre de l'équipe, ""management"" ou plutôt coaching axé sur le feedback, possibilité de travailler en remote ou de chez soi, etc.

Pour en savoir plus sur nos offres de poste, c'est par ici: https://jobs.lever.co/360learning","360Learning est la 1ère solution de ""Collaborative Learning"" qui permet aux départements de Formation d'engager leurs apprenants par la collaboration et de piloter l’apprentissage en fonction des priorités du business.

Depuis nos bureaux de Paris, Londres et New York, nous aidons nos 1 200 clients répartis dans 160 pays à se transformer en organisations apprenantes, comme Criteo, Galeries Lafayette, Chanel, Safran, ou encore Michelin.
