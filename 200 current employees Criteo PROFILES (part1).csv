Our teams are dispersed across multiple locations including Paris, Grenoble, Palo Alto, Ann Arbor and Bucharest. 

@Criteo R&D, we love great engineers. We love using tech such C#, Java, Scala, Hadoop, Angular, Hadoop, Vertica and many many more.

CRITEO delivers personalised performance marketing at an extensive scale. Measuring return on post-click sales, making ROI transparent and easy to measure. Criteo has 2,800+ employees in 30+ offices across the Americas and EMEA, serves over 14000 advertisers worldwide and maintains direct relationships with over 18,000 publishers. 

Our technology takes machine  learning based approaches to determining what user we show an ad to, when, and for what products. Billions of unique adverts are created and displayed at lightning fast speeds. 

Here are a few figures (we REALLY like data): 
- 8 DCs on 3 continents, > 20000 servers, a few tens of Petabytes on our HPC cluster 
- 120B HTTP requests and 4B unique banners displayed daily
- Respond to bids in 80ms or less, 24/7
- Peak 3M http requests/sec
- 6 ms avg to select optimal campaign
- 10 ms to find best product in catalogue of 100M 
- 120B ad calls per day
- 20TB of new data stored daily 
- 50PB of raw storage 

Criteo R&D develops the infrastructure and tools that allow us to manage these ever increasing volumes of data. More advertisers supplying more catalogs of products, more publishers and more user variables mean that we are working in a very fast-paced release cycle and are adding new capabilities weekly and even daily.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mounirsouidi/,,"Je suis tombé, un peu par hasard, dans le « digital sourcing » dès 2011. Au départ, l’idée était d’user astucieusement et à moindre frais de la puissance de google, dans le but d’identifier des talents. 
Mes lectures AND mon goût pour les nouvelles technologies m’ont conforté dans ce choix de devenir Digital Sourceur. 

Je considère le recrutement dans une approche globale, qui mêle technicité (Recherche Boolèenne / SEO..), marketing (Marketing RH – Marque Employeur), analyse (HR analytics) et surtout l’affectivité (écoute / communication).
En tant que recruteur, je suis toujours soucieux d'apporter des solutions, dans une approche constructive. Mon but est de bâtir des relations à moyen OR long terme, bénéfiques pour toutes les parties prenantes. AND NOT des relations « one shot ».

L’analyse, la créativité et l’audace constituent le triptyque pour repousser encore un peu plus les limites de mes compétences.

Rachelle Yenkamala, créatrice de moments d'attention monétisables !

Dans le contexte économique actuel, c’est désormais une question de survie de s’adapter, se diversifier, de pivoter et d’adopter la transition numérique.

J’aide ainsi les entreprises à développer leur stratégie de présence numérique sur les réseaux sociaux pour leurs clients et prospects.
J’accompagne la mise en œuvre afin d’assurer une bonne visibilité, 
de générer du traffic qualifié
et de surveiller l’e-réputation de l’entreprise.

Pour cela je mets à profit mes 13 années d'expertises webmarketing reconnues au sein d'agences de publicité notoires à l'échelle globale Criteo, Tedemis, 1000Mercis...

Je suis certifiée bac+5 MBA Directrice Marketing E-business & Innovation complétée par une formation en ligne Social Media Management qui me permet de me mettre à jour des nouveaux usages ebusiness et surtout ma détermination sans faille à atteindre les objectifs et à les dépasser.

 J'identifie des opportunités de croissance, je recommande et pilote des initiatives e-business innovantes en vue de maximiser les performances de conversion et les expériences client.

En 13 années j’ai pu maîtriser les différents canaux et outils :  Sites internet, Référencement, Emailing, collecte de leads, display, dispositifs web to store...et désormais toutes les mécaniques d’engagement et de conversation : social media, community management, storytelling…

 Passionnée par pur plaisir de découvrir, d'apprendre, de vivre bien... 
je mets à contribution mon audace, ma curiosité et ma détermination du cœur pour renforcer votre visibilité numérique et favoriser une communication durable et affinitaire avec vos clients cibles. 

Nos objectifs sont alignés ? 
Je vous propose d'en discuter de vive voix à l'occasion d'une prochaine rencontre.
